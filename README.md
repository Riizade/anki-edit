# Dictionaries

the code in `./core/dictionaries` requires dictionaries downloaded from a source such as the following:

- https://github.com/MarvNC/yomichan-dictionaries
- https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/yomichan-and-epwing-dictionaries.html

because this project is an absolute mess, you're better off looking at the code that loads the dictionaries and making changes to it rather than trying to follow the directory/file structure of whatever I've done here
