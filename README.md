# Dictionaries

the code in `./core/dictionaries` requires (Yomichan or stardict) dictionaries downloaded from a source such as the following:

- https://github.com/MarvNC/yomichan-dictionaries
- https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/yomichan-and-epwing-dictionaries.html
- https://sites.google.com/site/gtonguedict/home/stardict-dictionaries
- http://download.huzheng.org/

because this project is an absolute mess, you're better off looking at the code that loads the dictionaries and making changes to it rather than trying to follow the directory/file structure of whatever I've done here

however, you can find the dictionary data I used here: (TODO: insert link; Google Drive gives me a 500 error of some kind at the moment)
