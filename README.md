# anki-edit

Small personal repository for editing Anki flashcards

# Caution

When running these scripts, do _not_ have Anki open to your actual Anki account. Use a testbed account so that if something goes wrong, your actual flashcard progress is not affected

# Dictionaries

the code in `./core/dictionaries` requires (Yomichan or stardict) dictionaries downloaded from a source such as the following:

- https://github.com/MarvNC/yomichan-dictionaries
- https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/yomichan-and-epwing-dictionaries.html
- https://sites.google.com/site/gtonguedict/home/stardict-dictionaries
- http://download.huzheng.org/

because this project is an absolute mess, you're better off looking at the code that loads the dictionaries and making changes to it rather than trying to follow the directory/file structure of whatever I've done here

however, you can find the dictionary data I used here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-3PXPh_vrPsp-ojzPFKjaZAFcRWCExy-?usp=share_link
